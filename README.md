# Batch Scripts Inspired by Natasha Romanoff, the Black Widow, and the MCU

The creation of these batch scripts was inspired by Natasha Romanoff from *Captain America: The Winter Soldier*, who was running a side operation while the rest of the S.T.R.I.K.E. team, led by Captain America, focused on bringing down the pirates led by Georges Batroc and freeing the Lemurian Star. When Steve Rogers crashed into a server terminal room and found the Black Widow inside, and asked what she was doing there, she casually said, "...backing up the hard drive; it’s a good habit to get into..."

## Overview of Batch Scripts

### main backup.bat
The main `backup.bat` script requires you to set the SOURCE directory. It will copy all files from the specified SOURCE directory to the DESTINATION directory.

### search and copy backup.bat
The search and copy `backup.bat` allows the user to search for files containing a specified word within a designated directory and back them up to a specified destination.

### dynamic path backup.bat
The dynamic path `backup.bat` automates the backup process for specific user directories (Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Pictures, and Videos) to a designated backup location.

### faster copy option
The faster copy option performs a backup of specified user folders (Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Pictures, and Videos) while temporarily suspending specified processes and logs the entire operation to a log file.

## Compile and Execute
You will need to compile these as .exe files for execution.

## A Word of Caution

Please use these scripts responsibly and only with proper, legitimate access to the SOURCE.

Please note that incorrect execution of batch scripts, especially within PowerShell, could irrevocably damage registries, and corrupt your data. Exercise caution and responsibility.
